      <p>How will you spend the years ahead? That may depend on the long-term care insurance you choose today.</p>
      <p>Like most people, you probably recognize the need for long-term care insurance. It's not simply "nursing home"
        coverage, but insurance that helps assure you of continued independence as you age - without depleting the
        personal assets you've worked hard to acquire. But choosing the right protection from the many plans available
        can be a daunting task. OSDIA, in partnership with Long Term Care Global and Long Term Care Resources, offers a
        comprehensive Long Term Care Program. Members are entitled to a special discount on certain LTC plans available
        through this program.</p>
      <p>Carriers for coverage include John Hancock, Mutual of Omaha, and United of Omaha, MedAmerican, TransAmerica and
        Genworth.</p>
